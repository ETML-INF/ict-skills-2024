    # Competitor Instructions

    ## Work

    For the whole competition you will be provided with approximately **three hours**. The work is grouped into three parts.

    <ModulesTable
      columns={[
        {
          label: 'Module',
          render: (module) => <Link href={`/modules/${module.id}`}>{module.name}</Link>,
        },
        {
          label: 'Time',
          render: (module) => module.metadata.time,
        },
        {
          label: 'Points',
          render: (module) => module.totalPoints,
        },
      ]}
    />

    **Working time**:
    There are too many tasks on purpose and you are not expected to complete all tasks within the three hours.
    Focus on your strengths and spend more time on those tasks that will get you the most points.

    **Work order**:
    You are free to choose your own working order.

    ## Work folder

    The work folder is located under `work/`.

    It is important that you **do not move any work files** to another directory, otherwise they will not be assessed.
